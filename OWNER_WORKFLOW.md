# HexaBill Owner Workflow

This document defines the recommended setup order for company owners (distributors/wholesalers) so they know where to start and what to do next.

## Recommended order

1. **Company info & VAT** — Set company name, address, VAT number, currency (e.g. AED), and country. Done in **Settings** or during signup onboarding.
2. **Branches** — Add at least one physical location (warehouse, office). Required for organizing routes and staff. Go to **Branches & Routes** → Add branch.
3. **Routes** *(optional)* — Add delivery or field-sales routes under a branch. Go to **Branches & Routes** → select a branch → Add route.
4. **Users (staff)** — Invite staff and assign them to branches or routes. Go to **Users** → Add user.
5. **Products** — Add what you sell (name, SKU, price, stock). Go to **Products** → Add product.
6. **Purchases** *(optional)* — Record stock intake from suppliers. Go to **Purchases** → New purchase.
7. **Customers** — Add who you sell to. Customers can be assigned to a route. Go to **Customers** (or **Customer Ledger**) → Add customer.
8. **First invoice** — Create your first sale from **POS** or **Sales Ledger**: select customer, add products, create invoice.

## Why this order?

- **Branches first:** Routes and staff belong to branches; you need at least one location.
- **Routes next:** Field/delivery structure lives under a branch (skip if single location).
- **Staff next:** Assign staff to routes/branches after those exist.
- **Products:** Needed for purchases and for invoicing.
- **Purchases:** Optional; use when you receive stock from suppliers.
- **Customers:** Needed for invoicing; can be linked to a route.
- **First invoice:** First transaction that ties products and customers together.
